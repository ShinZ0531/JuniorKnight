Just try to find a way to record some of my learning process about Unity.

## Scripts

PlayerController.cs: temp reference. **animator** part is useful. Can face the right orientation within turning. Collision happens when touching the Air Wall.   
**PlayerController2D.cs**: It is fluent when walking with Air Wall, without collision. You should use this one to control the game character.  

### Dialog System
DialogSystem.cs: The first version. It can be used to supply a basic talk between max to 4 people.  
**DialogSystemV2.cs**: **Still working**. Try to use Excel instead of txt to store the talking content.  
SmallDialogSystem.cm: Just used for the small talk. Mostly it is just some description about the environment where the character is.
