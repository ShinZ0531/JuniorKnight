Just try to find a way to record some of my learning process about Unity.

## Scripts

PlayerController.cs: temp reference. **animator** part is useful. Can face the right orientation within turning. Collision happens when touching the Air Wall.   
**PlayerController2D.cs**: It is fluent when walking with Air Wall, without collision. You should use this one to control the game character.
